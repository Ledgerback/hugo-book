### [MetagovDAO Call for Proposals: Research + Community](https://metagov.org/metagovdao-call-for-proposals-research-community/)

> This is a rolling funding opportunity for participants in the Metagov community and other researchers to receive support for their work. We are looking to support projects that:
> 
> -   engage in original, creative **research** on online governance, DAOs, or other topics relevant to Metagov’s mission,
>     
> -   enliven the Metagov research **community** through events, relationship-building, and learning opportunities that share research, and/or
>     
> -   produce open-source or open-access research as **public goods**.
>     
> 
> We especially encourage submissions based on collaborations between multiple members of the Metagov community (i.e. find a collaborator in Metagov) and submissions that connect members of the Metagov community with members of Gitcoin and the GitcoinDAO (i.e. collaborators from Gitcoin or GitcoinDAO count too). To join the Metagov community, [read this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTqTS_6RUZMqh4qlL7WuVyrfMpLM-R6X3M9P2dxyK-fjbyio9J2yiVGPOW3jksjVYbb9a24HJyhJ3qB/pub).
> 
> Grants may be between the equivalent of USD$100 to $10,000; they will be paid in ETH, DAI, or USDC. For research projects, we expect to see a concrete deliverable such as a blog post or a seminar presentation at the end of the grant period that presents the work in an accessible format to both the Metagov community and our partners in Gitcoin.

### [RSM Assembly Fellowship](https://rebootingsocialmedia.org/programs-projects/fellowship/)

> Building on the Berkman Klein Center’s successful [Assembly Fellowship](https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2021about), the RSM Assembly Fellowship aims to produce prototypes, frameworks, and other projects in the public interest, including in engineering, law, design, institutional innovation, and policy. Alongside this project work, the Fellowship aims to develop the professional community focused on (re)building social media in service of democracy and the public interest. Examples of impactful outputs from past programs at the Berkman Klein Center include [Disinfodex](https://disinfodex.org/), [Data Nutrition Project](https://datanutrition.org/), [Clean Insights](https://cleaninsights.org/), as well as transformative institutions such as Creative Commons. Learn more about the past five years of Assembly [here](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/five-years-of-assembly-e52809c41749).
> 
> If you have a powerful idea, project, or plan — or parts of one — for an intervention in this space, or if you’re looking to make a more direct impact in the public interest, the RSM Assembly Fellowship might be for you.
