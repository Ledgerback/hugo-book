# Ledgerback Frontier Awards

Here are some awards I am thinking of issuing to recognize outstanding work at the Ledgerback Frontier for 2022.

The primary objective of the Ledgerback Frontier Awards is to identify and recognize individuals and organizations (loose- or tight-knit) that have made outstanding contributions at the Ledgerback Frontier, but also towards creating a positive impact for the future.

I plan to split each award into two or three sections:

1.  Judgesâ€™-choice (nominations not accepted),
    
2.  Publicsâ€™-choice (nominations accepted), _and_ _possibly_
    
3.  Membersâ€™-choice (members-only nominations).
    

I will be working on the criteria for each award.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you have any nominations for an award. Additionally, if there any additional activities an individual or community is undertaking that you think should be recognized with an award.

You can find the list of potential awards below.

1.  **Research** Award recognizing an outstanding achievement by an individual or organization in furthering the understanding of a field of knowledge at the Ledgerback Frontier (technically, papers can also fall here)
    
2.  **Convergence** Award recognizing an outstanding achievement by an individual or organization in connecting and integrating one or more sectors of the Ledgerback FrontierÂ 
    
3.  **Education** Award recognizing an outstanding achievement by an individual or organization in promoting education at the Ledgerback Frontier
    
4.  **Culture** Award recognizing an outstanding achievement by an individual or organization in promoting cultural activities at the Ledgerback FrontierÂ 
    
5.  **Investigator** award recognizing an outstanding achievement monitoring and investigating the activities of actors, resources, and apps in the Ledgerback Frontier in support ofÂ  the wider publicâ€™s interestÂ 
    
6.  **Societal & Environmental Impact** Award recognizing an outstanding achievement by an individual or organization in using technologies and/or organizing models in the Ledgerback Frontier for social and/or environmental good
    

# Ledgerback Frontier Portal

The Ledgerback Frontier Portal is a gateway to the Ledgerback Frontier (i.e., the Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields). The aim of the portal is to help people brave the Ledgerback Frontier through self-study.

You can find the Frontier Portalâ€™s repository for self-study resources on Web3 **[here](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invDl4qQaPsZFJbrq&inviteToken=7a9ea0c4feecc4031bf0d5b007c1a0bc7dbd7fdf324658b78be21801fd654083&utm_source=email)**.

Please let us know your thoughts and if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.
