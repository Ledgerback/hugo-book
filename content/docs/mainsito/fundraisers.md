[Conference](https://www.every.org/ledgerback-digital-commons-research-cooperative/f/conference): Help us raise funds to run a conference covering a topic on emerging technologies, organizational forms, human-compatibel futures, independnet research, or another topic of interest, that can help connect the public with our members and other persons of interest
3. [Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.every.org/ledgerback-digital-commons-research-cooperative/f/cloud-infrastructure): Help us pay for our cloud infrastructure costs so that we can provide more resources to our members to conduct their research
