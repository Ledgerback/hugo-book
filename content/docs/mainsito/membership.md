# Join our Flock


We are a global community of curiosity-driven change-makers ("storks") who share knowledge, time, values and ideas to help steer humanity towards a future that benefits everyone. Together, we empower people to access, use and build upon knowledge from the frontiers for positive outcomes. 

Our community is for anyone (academics, engineers, lifelong learners, entrepeneurs, citizens, independent researchers, designers, artists, etc.) who is interested in exploring the frontiers and wants to make a positive impact on the world, to connect and collaborate with each other.



Our community has different modes of involvement, with some folks choosing to join our events, some just browsing discussions in Discord, some just working on institution-building, some just using the LDCRC's products and services, and others working full- or part-time on projects.
