## About us


The LDCRC provides the infrastructure for community-led intiatives to learn, connect, experiment, and build at the frontiers.




## Strategic Plan and Institutional Model

The Networked-Cognitive Cooperative Institute (NC2I), further described below, is an institutional model and strategic plan for the LDCRC. For more information on the model, strategic plan, and background readings, please read the NC2I [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sw7ymgunQRJ9OVvJo9NPRvvdA3ebUR8ZpHufkBo5RIo/edit?usp=sharing). The NC2I is still a work-in-progress so any comments or other feedback is much appreciated.

### Institutional Model


The NC2I is a model for building a digital cooperatively-owned and -governed institute ("research cooperative") to scaffold the human-centric side of the frontier, connect academia, industry and society, sustainably steward knowledge-based resources and tools, and expand the ability for anyone to generate, access, use and build upon knowledge from the frontiers. knowledge about the frontier. The NC2I builds upon the institutional forms of an independent scholar institute, cooperative, and tech nonprofit, and is inspired by other initiatives for new kinds of research organizations such as Focused Research Organizations, Private ARPA, etc.


For background, a research cooperative (i.e., community-owned research institute) is a purpose-built, values-driven, and people-centered environment for research, development, education, and/or commercialization, generally oriented towards the social good or public interest.





### Strategic Plan

These initiatives (described as programs) are ways to approach growing the LDCRC as an institution.

The programs are:

1.  Cottage Program: obtain cloud infrastructure, tax-exempt status, basic membership base, team development, and early-stage funding
    
2.  Connectivity Program: connecting LDCRC to other people and entities at the frontier, develop an audience-research fit, and develop fruitful partnerships
    
3.  Library Program: initiative to crowdsource data, intelligence and knowledge into databases (or directories) for discovery engines to support research, decision-making, education, and participation at the frontier.
    

The initiatives are for building the institute's internal capacity, further implementing the NC2I model, have the LDCRC seen as a valuable research resource, and developing the LDCRC's ecosystem through a [portfolio of projects](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/parpa-2-pager.pdf).




### Theory of Change

Through our work, we will:

-   narrow the time between when discoveries are made at the frontiers of technology, science, and society (“frontier”) and when they are disseminated to the public,
    
-   [expand the talent pool of people](https://progress.institute/broadening-the-knowledge-economy-through-independent-scholarship/) who can participate in research (or curiosity-driven exploration or self-directed research) at the frontier
    
-   spread awareness of human-centric futures (or narratives of such things) into discussions regarding the frontier
    

- spread awareness of or develop sustainable and equitable models for value generation and distribution of data-, information-, and knowledge-based resources and tools

### Values



1.  Solution-agnostic
    
2.  Interdependence
    
3.  Maximum creativity

## Identity


### Name

Ledgerback is a combination of "ledger" and "back." *Ledger* comes from the term Distributed Ledgers (which is often used interchangeably with blockchain). *Back* comes from the slang term "greenback."  
  
The term is meant to recognize that we are currently living in a transitory period where we are re-evaluating our relationships with technologies, institutions, work, and more, and the need to identify the paradigm shifts to help understand this new world. 

We chose "Ledgerback" based on the history of the slang term "greenback." Greenback arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper (hence the name greenback). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on.  
  
Though this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept that paper money has *underlying value*  without a second thought.  

We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, e.g., Web2 to Web3, Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0, and that the vairous fields working on making this transition occur are at the frontier or the edge of what is currently known (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier).
  
We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, where we are moving from soelly physical systems to digital, networked systems, especially those based on blockchains (i.e., systems that are backed by a cryptographic ledger).

### Mascot

Our mascot is our super adorable and quick-witted stork you see in our logo, Scout Stork. Scout is flying across the frontiers to find and share knowledge. Thus, our members are known as storks.
