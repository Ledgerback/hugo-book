# About

Ledgerback Research is a 501(c)(3) worker cooperative and and decentralized research lab enacting the SDCI, a model for a knowledge ecosystem.

We study and build convergence (connection and integration) (emphasis on the alternative/decentralized internet), democratic ownership models, social technology, citizen-expertise, and tools for thought (TfT).

We produce open-access research (similarly to an academic or industry lab), including scientific publications, reports, blog posts, educational videos, open-source software, and demonstrations, and with these nurture the growth of researchers.

## Mission, Vision and Manifesto

### Mission
*Being updated*


### Vision

Our vision is a [Global Tech Commonwealth (GTC)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.00029/full), a commons-oriented future where sociotechnical systems incorporate the technological design practices of:

-   > radically enabling democratic organizing,
-   > incorporating planetary boundaries,
-   > modelling on natural biological ecosystems,
-   > redefining what is considered valuable, and
-   > allowing for the growth of a cooperative commons.

## Name

Ledgerback is a combination of "ledger" and "back." Ledger comes from the term Distributed Ledgers (which is often used interchangeably with blockchain). Back comes from the slang term "greenback."  
  
The word is meant to recognize that we are currently in a transitory period and identifying the paradigm shifts needed to move our current system to blockchain-based systems (though, this can be expanded to the global technological commonwealth).  
  
We chose "Ledgerback" based on the history of the slang term "greenback." Greenback as a term arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper (hence the name greenback). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on.  
  
Though this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept paper money as money without a second thought.  
  
We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, where we are moving from paper (physical) to distributed ledgers (digital), or to ledgerbacked systems, (i.e., systems that are built on top of blockchains and are backed and secured by the blockchain's inherent properties and a society pushed by blockchain values and thinking), and even greater than that, a global technological commonwealth.

## Mascot

Our mascot is our super adorable and quick-witted stork you see in our logo, Scout Stork (SÃ˜S). Scout is scouting the world for fellow storks to flock with in gaining and disseminating knowledge to others by delivering ideas and causing paradigm-shifts across the land.
