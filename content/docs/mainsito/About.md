# About

Founded in 2018, the Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative (LDCRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cooperative association for advancing knowledge in the Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier), through research, education, technology, monitoring, and advocacy.

Our outputs from our work can include scientific publications, reports, blog posts, open educational resources, trainings, tools, methods, platforms, open-source software, open datasets, newsletters, demonstrations, and more.

## Name

Ledgerback is a combination of "ledger" and "back." *Ledger* comes from the term Distributed Ledgers (which is often used interchangeably with blockchain). *Back* comes from the slang term "greenback."  
  
The term is meant to recognize that we are currently living in a transitory period where we are re-evaluating our relationships with technologies, institutions, work, and more, and the need to identify the paradigm shifts to help understand this new world. 

We chose "Ledgerback" based on the history of the slang term "greenback." Greenback arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper (hence the name greenback). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on.  
  
Though this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept that paper money has *underlying value*  without a second thought.  

We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, e.g., Web2 to Web3, Indsutry 3.0 to Indsutry 4.0, and that the vairous fields working on making this transition occur are at the frontier or the edge of what is currently known (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier).
  
We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, where we are moving from soelly physical systems to digital, networked systems, especially those based on blockchains (i.e., systems that are backed by a cryptographic ledger).

## Mascot

Our mascot is our super adorable and quick-witted stork you see in our logo, Scout Stork. Scout is scouting the world for new knowledge and getting ready to deliver to you the latest insights from the Ledgerback Frontier and even what awaits us past the frontier.
