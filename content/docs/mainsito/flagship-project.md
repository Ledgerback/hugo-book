# Projects


These member-led projects are currently under development:

1. Observatory: An ecosystem mapping of people, events, language, concepts, databases, media, organizations, and more at the Ledgerback Frontier;
2. Ledgerback Frontier Portal: A gateway to the Ledgerback Frontier (i.e., the Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields). The aim of the portal is to help people learn about and discover the Ledgerback Frontier through self-study resources (e.g., datasets, flashcards, quizzes);
3. Bikestream: A project to encourage people to realize the value and benefits of managing their mobility data and micro-mobility vehicles, individually and collectively;
4. DGov Score Framework: A project to develop a theoretical background on digital organizations and methods and tools for analyzing organizational concepts;
5. Laplace: A project to develop an expertise network, knowledge graph, and content aggregator to encourage innovation and learning at the Ledgerback Frontier
6. LedgerbackHub: a content library of thoughts and insights from members and friends on the Ledgerback Frontier; and
7. Distroid: a monthly newsletter, with a focus on the convergence (connection and integration) of the decentralized web and related fields (Web3, Platform Cooperatives, etc.) (i.e., the fields of the Ledgerback Frontier).

Charles Adjovu is working on the projects above (check Charles's digital garden for thoughts and updates on the projects).
