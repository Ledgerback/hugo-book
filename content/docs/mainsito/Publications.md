# Publications

## Ongoing
We have three ongoing publications:

1. [LedgerbackHub](https://blog.ledgerback.coop/),
2. [Distroid](https://distroid.substack.com/), and
3. [Ledgerback Podcast](https://anchor.fm/philomath-ledgerback).

Our long-form writing is on the [LedgerbackHub](https://blog.ledgerback.coop/), but may also be found on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ledgerback)

The Distroid newsletter is a monthly newsletter, with a focus on the convergence (connection and integration) of the decentralized web and related fields (Web3, Platform Cooperatives, etc.) (i.e., the fields of the Ledgerback Frontier).

The LedgerbackHub is a content library of thoughts and insights from members and friends on the Ledgerback Frontier.

The Ledgerback Podcast is a podcast covering member thoughts and insights on the Ledgerback Frontier, and interviews with guests working at the frontier.
