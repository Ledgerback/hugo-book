# Library



Weâ€™re aiming to assemble collections of academic and grey literature that can support researchers and citizens learn and investigate the frontiers.

We have two main databases, our [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2427813/ledgerback_digital_commons_research_cooperative) library (primarily research literature) and our [Portal database](https://airtable.com/shrHKnLvXOfOMrAOX) (primarily a recommended list of resources about a topic under the frontiers). 

Additionally, we also curate producitivty tips for research and knowledge work in general.

## Portal

Currently, we have a curated list for Web3 that goes over the basics, and provides a critical review of claims in the Web3 field concerning decentralization, trustlessness, and other important concepts. 

Additionally, we have a curated listfor Platform Cooperatives that goes over the main drivers of the field, such as labor issues, monopoly power, and venture capital, and then the basics, opportuntiies and struggles of platform cooperatives as an enterprise and the future imaginaries the field sets out to create. 

Currently, we are also working on developing lists for:

1. Tools for Thought
3. Human-compatible Futures
4. Web3 & Cooperatives


## Productivity Tips
We also curate producitivty tips and methods to help ease the research experienece and improve productivity. 

You can see an example in [Interesting Research Tools, Spotlight on Liberate Science, and the Pomodoro Technique](https://ledgerback.substack.com/p/interesting-research-tools-spotlight).

Additionally, check out the [Scholar Toolbox and Guide](https://airtable.com/shr9VdCpCLlNkbPuu) for more tools to help make research and communicating findings easier.
