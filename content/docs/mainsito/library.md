# Library



Weâ€™re aiming to assemble collections of academic and grey literature that would help people learn about emerging technologies and their implications for the future. 

We have two main libraries, our [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2427813/ledgerback_digital_commons_research_cooperative) library (primarily research literature) and our [Portal database](https://airtable.com/shrHKnLvXOfOMrAOX)(primarily a curated list of  resources about a field at the Ledgerback Frontier to help you learn the basics). 


## Portal

Currently, we have a curated list for Web3 that goes over the basics, and provides a critical review of claims in the Web3 field concerning decentralization, trustlessness, and other important concepts. 

Additionally, we have a curated listfor Platform Cooperatives that goes over the main drivers of the field, such as labor issues, monopoly power, and venture capital, and then the basics, opportuntiies and struggles of platform cooperatives as an enterprise and the future imaginaries the field sets out to create. 

Currently, we are also working on developing curated lists for:

1. Tools for Thought
3. Human-compatible Futures
4. Web3 & Cooperatives
