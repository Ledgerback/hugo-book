## Papers


### [A Preliminary Review of Blockchain in the Music Industry (November 6, 2018)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3280838)
> Musicians in the music industry are the primary content creators, and yet, have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their rights and management to third party intermediaries such as record labels, performance rights organizations, and publishers. Before the rise of file sharing platforms in the 1990s, this scenario was the norm for all musicians as record labels controlled nearly all facets of the music industry from musician funding to distribution and even royalty payment collection. Many thought file sharing platforms such as Napster and LimeWire, which we deem "the first wave of disruption," would wrestle control of the music industry from record labels to musicians, but that has not occurred as of this writing. The rise of blockchain-based interventions in the music industry, which we have termed the "second wave of disruption," may finally lead the music industry to transition to a musician-centered ecosystem, with few if any intermediaries, and bring musicians and fans/consumers closer than ever before. Despite the various promises of blockchain technology, the use of blockchain is primed, and dare we say, destined, to change the music industry. Though, with any such change, there will be issues that must be properly managed to ease the transition from legacy systems to blockchain-based systems (\Legacy-to-Blockchain"). There are many issues pioneers in this field will have to face stemming from the music industry itself and the inherent limitations of blockchain technology, but in doing so, we recommend that blockchain-based intervention projects and pioneers implement six strategies to counter these issues and bring the blockchain-based music industry into fruition.

### [Blockchain-mediated Licensing: Legal Engineering for Artist Empowerment ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3625317)

> Licensing is one of the essential means of exploiting the monetary value of a musical work, and yet it is an area fraught with many issues and transactional costs which make it a difficult process for individuals and organizations. Many issues in music licensing arise from the legal complexity (e.g., national and international copyright law), business complexity (authentication, tracking, accounting, etc.), value web complexity (transparency of relationships among stakeholders), and technical complexity (e.g., establishing a global repertoire database for music, sufficient metadata standards) of working with music. Then, in addition to these issues, there are specific transactional costs (identification, negotiation, monitoring, and enforcement) associated with the licensing process. To mitigate the complexity and transactional costs associated with music and the licensing process, researchers and technologists have been investigating how new technologies and design models from the Web3 space, such as blockchain, linked data and Ricardian Contracts, can automate processes to reduce complexity, speed up payments, improve tracking, and provide other benefits in the music industry. In our report, we make our own attempt to reduce the complexity and transactional costs in the licensing process by developing an automated music license. In doing so, we first conducted a literature review synthesizing the intersection of music complexity and Web3 technologies to provide background and context to automating music licensing. Then we developed the Practical Tokenized Drafting (PTD) method, a set of core principles and practices for drafting Ricardian Contracts that interact with Web3 technologies (RC-Web3 Templates), and the Tokenized Music License (TML), an RC-Web3 Template standard form for music licensing on the OpenLaw platform. Both the PTD and TML can be adapted to meet the needs of music industry stakeholders and provide guidance to legal practitioners in drafting RC-Web3 Templates.

### [Blockchain and the Rise of the Internet Cooperative](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3750540)

> Cooperatives and blockchain projects appear to be unrelated until a deeper look is taken into blockchain projects and their associated communities. Cooperatives and blockchain projects both promote substantially similar principles and values centered around democratic member control and the freedom for individuals to come together for their own mutual benefit. There are two types of cooperativism which expressly account for the ability for blockchain to further cooperatives, platform cooperativism and open cooperativism. Further, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), take the combination of blockchain and cooperativism even further through the cooperative management of an entity that is created on, managed on, and solely exists on a blockchain. the inner workings of blockchain make it extremely suitable for meeting the seven principles and values that unite cooperatives across the world and for expanding cooperative values and principles from local communities to global movements.

## Projects
### Databases and Search Engines
#### Observatory
 
Observatory is a comprehensive knowledge graph and search engine to discover people, organizations, events, problems, solutions, and more pertaining to emerging technologies and how they draw attention to human-centric futures. Primarily, you can think of the Observatory as your own personal research assistant.

The Observatory currently tracks:

1. people (scholars, entrepeneurs, technologists, etc.), 
2. organizations (research labs, etc.),
3. problems, 
4. solutions,
5. media (podcasts, news, etc.), 
6. events,
7. databases,
2.  dictionary (i.e., language or vocabulary),
7.  documents, 
8. talkspaces (i.e., online communities), and
9.  tools.


You can find a preview of the base on Airtable [here](https://airtable.com/shrrykCXWOnP2kMbL). Additionally, you can find a graph visualization of the dictionary [here](https://medium.com/@charles.adjovu/observatory-front-end-and-graph-visualization-of-glossary-79d0d1bc5d58). And the alpha website for the Observatory will be posted by Q3 2022.

#### Moyo

Moyo is an educational directory and open data platform for educational materials (content, tools, etc.) to help you learn about Web3, Platform Cooperatives, and other fields so that you can better imagine and participate in designing the future. Eventually, we hope to develop an assistive tool to help personalize learning.

Bikestream is a project to develop a user-owned Internet of Things (IoT) platform that allows cyclists (and logistics companies) to collect and share their electric bicycle (including battery) and location data (“mobility data”).

Primarily, Bikestream is meant to help develop data-driven methods to make last-mile logistics better and greener.

You can find the Github repo [here](https://github.com/Ledgerback/Bikestream).
##### Databike Prototype
Additionally, read our [Databike Report](https://www.hackster.io/ledgerback/databike-report-5eb9c2) to get a better idea of our prototype databike, a converted electric bicycle with a data logger that logs geolocation and electric bicycle data, developed under the project.

##### Data Logging Software

Python and Shell programs (intended for a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ in headless mode) for manipulating and streaming vehicle and geolocation data from an electric bicycle and smartphone to [Streamr](https://streamr.network/) in real-time.


### Governance and Organizational Design
#### Distributed Governance Score Framework
The Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF) is a project for developing a theoretical basis on digital organizations, especially [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://policyreview.info/pdf/policyreview-2021-2-1556.pdf), from an organization science/design perspective, and developing analytical tools to assess various aspects of digital organizations.

##### DAO Index
The DAO Index is an analytical tool (specifically, a self-assessment questionnaire) and open database that builds on the theoretical background to assess how a DAO is implementing a set of core organizing principles (8 as of version 0.8 of the questionnaire) that are oriented towards the community organizational form, into their governance structures and disclosures, based on publicly available information.

For more information about the DAO Index, please read this Hackernoon [post](https://hackernoon.com/distributed-governance-score-framework-dao-index) introducing the tool, and the [DAO Index Airtable base](https://airtable.com/shryg9HSUSyXNwdMR) covering organization design problems, current and past versions of the questionnaire (the current version is [Version 0.9](https://airtable.com/shrCGAvONwIicfOOe)), and past evaluations with the questionnaire.
