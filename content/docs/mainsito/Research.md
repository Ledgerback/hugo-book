# Research

Here you will find requests for research and early-stage concepts, and some helpful approaches to researching the Ledgerback Frontier. 

## Approach


Here are a list of research approaches that can help navigate the Ledgerback Frontier:

1. Convergent Research
2. Exploratory Research 
### Convergent Research



> [Convergence research is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation. Convergence research is related to other forms of research that span disciplines - transdisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and multidisciplinarity. It is the closest to transdisciplinary research which was historically viewed as the pinnacle of evolutionary integration across disciplines.](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp)


### Exploratory Research 

*TBA*

## Requests for Research

Here are requests for research (RFRs) made by members. RFRs are similar to Request for Prposals (RFPs), except that they are as not as in-depth and usually just focus on the major question at hand.

1. How would a cooperative conversion strategy for Peloton be constructued?
2. What are the expected benefits of a rewards program in which every platform cooperative in the world participates?

Some questions may be found in Charles's [Tokenization Experiments List](https://kylefox1.github.io/Quartz-Test/Garden-1/TokenizationExperiments-2021_0930-V0.1/).

## Early-stage concepts

Some early-stage concepts from Charles on [connecting Platform Cooperativism to Web3](https://medium.com/digital-cooperative-research/connecting-socio-technical-ecosystems-how-to-connect-web-3-0-and-platform-cooperatives-cd550df27d33).
