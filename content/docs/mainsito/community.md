# Community

Ledgerback Research is a community for genuinely curious people who are interested in getting better at learning, sharing, researching, and building democratic ownership models, networked-scholarship, networked-culture, social technology, and tools for thought (TfT) ("Topics").

To that end, the community building aspect of Ledgerback Research is creating a place to: 1) develop and train relevant skills for maturing into a researcher or maker, 2) find kindred spirits, friends and collaborators along the way, 3) produce serious research, 4) educate each other on interesting topics, and 5) give back to society.

To serve each individual's different communication style, comfortability, time commitment and social need, we have constructed 2 types of communities: 1) Forum and 2) Lab.


## Forum

The Forum is for all kinds of learners who are interested in learning about the Topics and improving their workflows and thinking.

The Forum primarily covers interesting readings, news, and 101s on Topics.

### I'm in. What do I do?

Here's how to participate. 

1.  Join the Discord to chat about Topics . First step: intro yourself in the #introductions channel!
2.  Join the [reading group]() if you like. Reading group papers are discussed in the #reading_group channel on Discord and lists are posted monthly.
4.  Make a 101 resource contribution to help aspiring learners get started!
6. Present your learning progress/journey or workflow in our monthly reading group meetings.
3.  Most announcements are posted on the[blog, Twitter, #general channel, and the Ledgerback Newsletter.
## Lab

The Lab is for all kinds of scholars (academic, independent, citizen, etc.) who are interested in researching and building Topics.

We expect that you already have a project in mind, but if not, you can ask for feedback on picking a research direction or project on Discord or try pitching it at our research meetings.

Experienced researchers looking to dedicate time to mentor projects and give advice to starters should consider joining the lab, with a light commitment of joining our research meetings where research updates are presented.

### I'm in. What do I do?

Here's how to participate. It's pretty informal.

1.  Join the Discord to chat about research or find collaborators. First step: intro yourself in the #introductions channel!
3.  Most announcements are posted on the blog, Twitter, posted in the #general channel, and the Ledgerback Newsletter.
4.  Make an Request For Progress contribution to help aspiring researchers get started!
6. Contact us or a member about your project and how you expect us to work together.
7. Write an article for our blog, record a podcast with us, or add a message to the newsletter.
8. Present your research, workflows, or project at our monthly research meetings.
