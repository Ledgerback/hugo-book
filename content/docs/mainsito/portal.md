# Ledgerback Frontier Portal 

The Ledgerback Frontier Portal is a gateway to the thought spaces at the Ledgerback Frontier, the space between the present and future ages of humanity, exemplified by  the Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields. The aim of the portal is to help people understand how people are thinking or conceptualizing these fields through self-study resources (primarily, through foundational reading lists).

You can find the Frontier Portalâ€™s repository for self-study resources on Web3 [**here**](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invDl4qQaPsZFJbrq&inviteToken=7a9ea0c4feecc4031bf0d5b007c1a0bc7dbd7fdf324658b78be21801fd654083&utm_source=email).
