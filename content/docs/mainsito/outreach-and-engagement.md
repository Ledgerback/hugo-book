# Outreach and Engagement

The LDCRC also works on community-building efforts, primarily outreach and public engagement, to inform the public about our pioneering research, and disoveries from the frontiers, assistance in career development, and acknowledging intellectual work (often untraditional work).


## Office Hours


LDCRC's weekly, pro-bono Office Hours provide the opportunity to receive one-on-one help with finding existing research, strategy, and/or general questions. Office Hours are held via Jitsi or Sprout video conferencing.
