	- Musicians in the music industry are the primary content creators, and yet, have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their rights and management to third party intermediaries such as record labels, performance rights organizations, and publishers. Before the rise of file sharing platforms in the 1990s, this scenario was the norm for all musicians as record labels controlled nearly all facets of the music industry from musician funding to distribution and even royalty payment collection. Many thought file sharing platforms such as Napster and LimeWire, which we deem "the first wave of disruption," would wrestle control of the music industry from record labels to musicians, but that has not occurred as of this writing. The rise of blockchain-based interventions in the music industry, which we have termed the "second wave of disruption," may finally lead the music industry to transition to a musician-centered ecosystem, with few if any intermediaries, and bring musicians and fans/consumers closer than ever before. Despite the various promises of blockchain technology, the use of blockchain is primed, and dare we say, destined, to change the music industry. Though, with any such change, there will be issues that must be properly managed to ease the transition from legacy systems to blockchain-based systems (\Legacy-to-Blockchain"). There are many issues pioneers in this field will have to face stemming from the music industry itself and the inherent limitations of blockchain technology, but in doing so, we recommend that blockchain-based intervention projects and pioneers implement six strategies to counter these issues and bring the blockchain-based music industry into fruition.

	- Licensing is one of the essential means of exploiting the monetary value of a musical work, and yet it is an area fraught with many issues and transactional costs which make it a difficult process for individuals and organizations. Many issues in music licensing arise from the legal complexity (e.g., national and international copyright law), business complexity (authentication, tracking, accounting, etc.), value web complexity (transparency of relationships among stakeholders), and technical complexity (e.g., establishing a global repertoire database for music, sufficient metadata standards) of working with music. Then, in addition to these issues, there are specific transactional costs (identification, negotiation, monitoring, and enforcement) associated with the licensing process. To mitigate the complexity and transactional costs associated with music and the licensing process, researchers and technologists have been investigating how new technologies and design models from the Web3 space, such as blockchain, linked data and Ricardian Contracts, can automate processes to reduce complexity, speed up payments, improve tracking, and provide other benefits in the music industry. In our report, we make our own attempt to reduce the complexity and transactional costs in the licensing process by developing an automated music license. In doing so, we first conducted a literature review synthesizing the intersection of music complexity and Web3 technologies to provide background and context to automating music licensing. Then we developed the Practical Tokenized Drafting (PTD) method, a set of core principles and practices for drafting Ricardian Contracts that interact with Web3 technologies (RC-Web3 Templates), and the Tokenized Music License (TML), an RC-Web3 Template standard form for music licensing on the OpenLaw platform. Both the PTD and TML can be adapted to meet the needs of music industry stakeholders and provide guidance to legal practitioners in drafting RC-Web3 Templates.

	- Cooperatives and blockchain projects appear to be unrelated until a deeper look is taken into blockchain projects and their associated communities. Cooperatives and blockchain projects both promote substantially similar principles and values centered around democratic member control and the freedom for individuals to come together for their own mutual benefit. There are two types of cooperativism which expressly account for the ability for blockchain to further cooperatives, platform cooperativism and open cooperativism. Further, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), take the combination of blockchain and cooperativism even further through the cooperative management of an entity that is created on, managed on, and solely exists on a blockchain. the inner workings of blockchain make it extremely suitable for meeting the seven principles and values that unite cooperatives across the world and for expanding cooperative values and principles from local communities to global movements.
