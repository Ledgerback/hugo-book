{{< expand "1. What is social technology?" "..." >}}
> [Social technology is the hardware and software that determine how we organize and collectively live our lives. But it is also the the ideas, knowledge, economics, and institutions that drive culture and sustain societies. And it is the way this knowledge is embedded in the technologies we use.](https://otherinter.net/about/)

{{< expand "2. What is a Tool for Thought(TfT)?" "..." >}}
> [A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the keyboard. What’s more, the term “tool” implies a certain narrowness. Alan Kay has arguedAgain, in Alan Kay, [User Interface: A Personal View](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf) (1989), among other places. that a more powerful aim is to develop a new _medium for thought_. A medium such as, say, Adobe _Illustrator_ is essentially different from any of the individual tools _Illustrator_ contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought.](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)

{{< expand "2.1. What is the difference between a tool and a medium?" "..." >}}
> [A tool is something that takes an existing workflow, and makes it more efficient. A nail is an efficient way of holding pieces of wood together; a to-do app is an efficient way of remembering your responsibilities. A medium, on the other hand, gives us new agency or power by which we can do something we couldn’t do before. As with any dichotomy, there are grey areas. Powerful, effective tools can become mediums and enablers too. The graphical computer user interface wasn’t just a better way to write scientific simulations or data processing systems – it also became a new medium for creative work. Programming languages began history as a more efficient way to store and maintain punchcard programs, but a half-century of innovation has made it a medium for expressing programs that couldn’t be written before.](https://thesephist.com/posts/browser/)

{{< expand "4. What is a platform business model?" "..." >}}
> [What we mean with a platform business is a business model (not a technology infrastructure) that focuses on helping to facilitate interactions across a large number of participants. These interactions could take the form of short-term transactions like connecting buyers and sellers or they could involve formation of longer-term social relationships, longer-term collaboration to achieve a shared outcome or sustained efforts to accelerate performance improvement of participants by helping them to learn faster together. The role of the platform business is to provide a governance structure and a set of standards and protocols that facilitate interactions at scale so that network effects can be unleashed.](https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/innovation/articles/platform-business-model-explained.html)
