# **Welcome!**
Founded in 2018, the Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative (LDCRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cooperative association coalescing a socially-aware research community for advancing knowledge in the decentralized web and related fields (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier) through research, education, technology, advocacy, and monitoring.

If you are new to LDCRC and want to help, here's what you should do:

1. Join our Slack or Discord, and remember to browse the channels and join the ones that interest you.
2. Sign up for our [newsletter](https://ledgerback.substack.com/) to stay informed about LDCRC events and other initiatives.
3. Book a call with one of our team members. We'd love to meet you and find out how we can help you improve the world.
4. Scroll through the list of resources in the Outputs page. Don't worry if you don't know where to start, we can figure that out together during the call. Just have a look so you know what resources exists.
5. Review our volunteer page to see what we need help with.
6. Pick an activity off the Game Board and get some rewards.
7. Look through our services to find the help you need.
8. Follow our Twitter account
