# Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative

Ledgerback Research is a 501(c)(3) worker cooperative and and decentralized research lab enacting the SDCI, a model for a knowledge ecosystem.

We study and build convergence (connection and integration) (emphasis on the alternative/decentralized internet), democratic ownership models, social technology, citizen-expertise, and tools for thought (TfT).
