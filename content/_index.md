# Advancing our understanding of the frontiers to aid in shaping the future for public benefit

Founded in 2018, the Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative (LDCRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focusing on the frontiers of technology, science, and society ("frontiers"), to aid in shaping the future for public benefit. Our community of curiosity-driven change-makers work across research, education, community-building, translation, and tool-building to achieve our mission. 

We welcome anyone who is interested in exploring the frontiers and wants to make a positive impact on the world.


Please consider supporting our work by making a tax-deductible donation, hiring us, or joining our community.
